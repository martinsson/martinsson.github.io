# Bio

Johan Martinsson is a freelance developer and craftsman that is passionate, amongst other things, about design in code. 
He has spent many years helping teams adopt XP-practices, in particular TDD and advanced coding. 
One of Johan's primary skills is the ability to contaminate almost anyone with at least a few craftsman practices.

Johan favorite way of making his point in conferences is by showing code. 

Johan organized the first code retreat in France, organized the first ever Legacy Code Retreat with JB Rainsberger.
Since 2009 he co-organizes the Grenoble coding dojo. In 2016 it was at its 130th session! He also co-organizes Franceâ€™s biggest agile event: Agile Grenoble.

## Usable Software Design
### Version 1
Did you ever think of the user of your code? Not the one using the application,
but the developer that has to change the code after you. Does that person
have a good tool for the job, i.e. is the code usable?

What can we learn from other domains like ergonomics, usability and in general design of objects,
where the user has been in the center of the design process for decades? Well first of all it
tells us what are the weaknesses of all designers, even the greatest and how to remedy that.

Secondly you'll learn why "It's not the users fault, it's the designs fault" and how
to remove sources of bugs using BugsZero design.

You'll get a fresh new perspective on Clean Code, difficulties in TDD and what's the power of DDD

Last but not the least, you'll discover how "Usable Software Design" naturally gets a lot of traction
where TDD and Clean Code meet resistance.

### Version 2
Did you ever think of the user of your code? Not the one using the application,
but the developer that has to change the code after you. Does that person
have a good tool for the job, i.e. is the code usable?

What can we learn from other domains where the power of user-centric design was discovered
decades ago and led to a win-win situation? Expert designers always repeat that

> You're not your user!

and

> It's not the users fault, it's the designs fault.

Why? What does that mean in our world of code, architecture and team practices? You can
expect plenty of code illustrating general principles of design and ergonomics. You'll go
home with simple but powerful tools.
