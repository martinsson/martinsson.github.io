Well in order to deliver software that not only corresponds to specification and not only satisfies customers but surprises users with its usefulness you have to \r\n\r\n1. state a clear goal\r\n1. deliver iteratively \r\n1. observe customer behaviour in order to adapt. \r\n\r\nHowever none of this is easy and in particular delivering in shorter and shorter iterations is an engineering challenge that very few teams and companies master. It certainly isn't taught in school!\r\n\r\nI can help you with that.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the symptoms that suggest that I could be useful to you?\r\n* You're agile since 6 months or more, but TDD isn't working for you\r\n* Business and tech aren't aligned as a team\r\n* You're struggling with legacy code\r\n* Your test suites takes a few hours to run\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nCheck out some of my projects and experiments @martinsson\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nWant to know more or share your problems with me over lunch?
